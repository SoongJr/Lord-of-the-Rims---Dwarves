  <!--  Royalty DLC uses RoomRequirement_Thing when there is only one vanilla thing that can go there instead of the more extensible RoomRequirement_ThingAnyOf.
        Any mod that wants to add items to this (including yours truly) has to rip out the old one and replace it with RoomRequirement_ThingAnyOf, and then adding their furniture to that.
        I have high hopes that the patch below will work whether or not some other mod already created a RoomRequirement_ThingAnyOf, without throwing any error messages or masking legitimate errors.
        Note that esquires and below don't have any bedroom requirements, so they're not listed here. NPC titles have a common base Def "BaseEmpireTitleNPC", so that at least simplifies things.

  <!-- Now, this next bit is less elegant: There is no existing RoomRequirement class that accepts multiple kinds of things AND requires multiple instances of them.
        Vanilla uses RoomRequirement_ThingCount to require 2 or more braziers, but there is no "RoomRequirement_ThingCountAnyOf" to "require 2 braziers and/or dwarven braizers".
        We can write one of course, and that's what I did, but this will not be compatible with other mods that do the same because they will have their own classes in their own namespace.
        Whichever mod comes first will succeed, and all others will fail. I've tried to work around that by ignoring the namespace so if someone did exactly the same as me and named their class either
        "RoomRequirement_ThingCountAnyOf" or "RoomRequirement_ThingAnyOfCount", it will work if we are loaded after them. If they decided to go with something else completely, I have no way of planning for that.
        This should also work if vanilla decides to introduce and use such a class (wiht one of those names) as we will just add our furniture tio that.
